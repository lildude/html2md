# html2md

Quick util to convert a directory of HTML files with frontmatter left over from a previous export from Wordpress to
plain old GFM Markdown using the [html-to-markdown](https://github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown) module, with
a few changes for my preferences.

Warning: this is destructive as it deletes the original HTML file if you ask it to.
